# Personal feeds — providers, status and digest scheduling

Plan: [personal feeds and daily digest](plans/2026-10-07-personal-feeds-and-daily-digest.md).

## Shipped (stage 1)

| Area | Status | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| News | Live | Public RSS/Atom allowlist in `backend/app/personal_news.py` (`FEEDS`): Federal Reserve, SEC, NPR (Economy/Business/Technology/Politics), Ars Technica, arXiv (math, stat.ML), Quanta. Headlines + links only; every item links to the publisher. |
| Daily digest | Built, **not scheduled** | `personal_digest.py`, `POST /internal/daily-digest/send` |
| Sports | **Built, no live provider** | `personal_sports.py`, `/api/v1/personal/sports`, Sports page. Provider boundary + normalizer + filters (league/team/conference/Top 25) are tested against fixtures. `PROVIDER` is `None`, so the page shows official scoreboard links until a source is approved (see spike below). |
| Shoes | **Built, no live provider** | `personal_shoes.py`, `/api/v1/personal/shoes`, Shoes page. User-managed watches and release links (write token), price-change detection with bounded history, fixture-tested. `PROVIDER` is `None` until eBay Browse production access is approved. No scraping. |

Feed liveness was checked once on 2026-10-07 (all 10 returned HTTP 200 and parsed). Each publisher's
reuse terms still need a read before relying on this beyond personal use; the app stores only titles and URLs.
Feed fetch errors are stored as a short code (`fetch_failed` / `parse_failed`), never the upstream body.

## Digest behaviour

- The endpoint sends only when Chicago local time is >= 08:00 **and** no digest was sent for that local date
  (`digest_runs`, primary key = `America/Chicago` date). Early calls return `too_early`; repeats return
  `already_handled`; an unconfigured/failed email leaves the day retryable.
- `?dry_run=true` renders and returns the digest without sending or writing anything.
- Needs `RESEND_API_KEY`, `ALERT_TO_EMAIL`, a verified `ALERT_FROM_EMAIL`, `INTERNAL_REPORT_SECRET`.
  Resend's default `onboarding@resend.dev` sender only delivers to the Resend account owner.

## Scheduling (manual, needs your approval — nothing is activated)

Use one daily job at [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) instead of an hourly GitHub Actions ping:

- URL: `https://aisaac-dashboard.fly.dev/internal/daily-digest/send` (method POST)
- Header: `X-Internal-Secret: <INTERNAL_REPORT_SECRET>` — note this stores the secret with a third party;
  consider a dedicated value if you rotate it separately.
- Schedule: every day 08:00, timezone **America/Chicago** (cron-job.org handles DST).
- Timeout 30 s (a cold Fly start plus feed refresh). Enable failure notifications.
- First run `?dry_run=true`, then one manual send, then enable the schedule after a few days of review.

## Provider spike (2026-10-07) — nothing approved

Searched, not yet verified against authoritative terms. No key was requested and no account created.

| Candidate | What was found | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ESPN scoreboard JSON | Undocumented; no published terms or limits | **Rejected** (plan forbids undocumented endpoints) |
| CollegeFootballData API | Free key, shared monthly call quota (reported ~1,000/month, may have changed); terms page dated Aug 2026 permits use. Could not confirm AP Top 25 or conference data is on the free tier. NFL/NBA/MLB not covered | **Candidate for NCAAF + rankings**; confirm tier page and rankings endpoint before use |
| TheSportsDB | Free key; sources conflict on rate limit and non-commercial terms; live scores need a paid tier | **Candidate for schedules**, terms to be read first |
| balldontlie | Free tier reported at 5 req/min, games/teams only; sources conflict | **Candidate for NBA schedules**, terms to be read first |
| eBay Browse API | Requires production approval | **Blocked** pending approval |

To enable a source: implement a callable that returns raw event dicts (see `personal_sports.normalize` for the shape), set `PROVIDER`, add its key via the existing secret workflow, and record the verified terms here. Games with no `url` fall back to the league's official scoreboard link; rankings are stored only when the provider supplies them with a poll date, and the UI treats a poll older than 8 days as unavailable.

## Connected accounts (eBay, StockX) — scaffolding only

Built and tested with fixtures: encrypted token vault (`personal_vault.py`, Fernet keyed from
`TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`), signed-state OAuth connect flow (`personal_connect.py`), read-only own-data
storage and endpoints (`personal_own.py`, `/api/v1/personal/own`, `/connections`, `/connect/{provider}`),
the "Your accounts" panel on the Shoes page, and an eBay Browse price-search provider
(`personal_ebay.py`, app token, enabled by `EBAY_CLIENT_ID` + `EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET`).

**Not done — needs the providers' official docs:** `personal_connect.SPECS` (authorize/token URLs,
scopes) and `personal_own.FETCHERS` (purchase/watchlist/bid/listing endpoints) are empty, so Connect
shows "not set up" for both. The eBay Browse request shapes are unverified against the live API.

To finish a provider: read its OAuth and account-data docs, add its `ProviderSpec` and a fetcher that
returns `{kind, id, title, price, url, occurred_at}` dicts, register the redirect URL
(`PUBLIC_BASE_URL` + `/api/v1/personal/connect/<provider>/callback`) in its developer portal, and set
`TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Everything stays read-only: no buying, bidding, listing or orders.

## StockX (2026-10-08, from the published swagger and auth docs)

- Connect: Auth0 authorization-code flow on `accounts.stockx.com` (`audience=gateway.stockx.com`,
  scope `offline_access openid`); API calls need the bearer token plus `x-api-key`.
- Own data: active listings (asks) and sales history only. The public API has no buyer purchase
  history, watchlist or buy-side bids.
- Price tracking: a `stockx` watch (size 10 or 10.5 only) takes the first catalog search hit for its
  keywords (use a style code) and records that size's lowest ask from `/market-data`.
- Pacing: 1 request/second, 25,000/day; calls are spaced in code and the access token is cached.
- Settings: `STOCKX_CLIENT_ID`, `STOCKX_CLIENT_SECRET`, `STOCKX_API_KEY`. Not verified live.
